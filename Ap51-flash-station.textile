h1. ap51-flash station for [[OpenWRT]]


[[OpenWRT]]-package:
* attachment:Makefile
* files/ attachment:ap51-flash.conf
* files/ attachment:ap51-flash.init


Example configuration of a Dlink DIR-300 as a ap51-flash station:
* minimal attachment:.config -file (kicking out a lot of the standard applications and modules to save as much RAM as possible and adding nfs-support for remote images)
* /etc/config/ attachment:network (configuring ports 1-4 as seperate VLANS for flashing other devices and the WAN-port as the adminstration port)
* /etc/ attachment:fstab (for mounting nfs-shares at boot time)

Example image (using the same config as stated above):

 * http://x-realis.dyndns.org/Freifunk/firmware/ap51-flash-station/

2-port-vlan without host learning (hub-mode, for debugging ap51-flash)

* /etc/config/network: attachment:network2
* /etc/init.d/ attachment:switch-2-hub
