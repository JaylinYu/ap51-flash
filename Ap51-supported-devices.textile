In general you can flash all devices which use the redboot bootloader that has the reflashing function enabled. ap51-flash will automatically detect redboot when you turn on the device. If your device is not in the "known to work" list which follows you still can try it and inform us about the result.

List of known to work redboot devices:[[BR]]

== Note on Mac OS X ==

If you need to use ap51 flash with OSX, please checkout version 252 and compile like this:

{{{
make ap51-flash-osx
}}}

Later versions lack Mac OS X support until someone adds it. If you feel you can close the gap, please contact us.
